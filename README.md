# data-acquisition-blog

This repo showcases the process I followed to create a novel data set of all of the Fats and Oils listed on the [USDAs](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-search?type=SR%20Legacy&SRFoodCategory=Fats%20and%20Oils) website in the Fats and Oils FoodCategory.

The data set in this repo contains data on 214 unique fats and oils. The data attributes I hve chosen to include are: fatoil_category,fatoil_type,energy(Kcal),protein(g),saturated_fat(g),trans_fat(g),monounsat_fat(g),polyunsat_fat(g),cholesterol(mg).
