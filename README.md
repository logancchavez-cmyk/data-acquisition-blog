# data-acquisition-blog

This repo showcases the process I followed to create a novel data set of all of the Fats and Oils listed on the [USDAs](https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/food-search?type=SR%20Legacy&SRFoodCategory=Fats%20and%20Oils) website in the Fats and Oils FoodCategory.

The data set in this repo contains data on 225 unique fats and oils. The data attributes I hve chosen to include are: Fat/Oil Name, energy, protein, saturated fat, trans fat, monounsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium.
